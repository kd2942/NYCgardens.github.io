<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>New York City is infamously known as the concrete jungle with
approximately 1 million structors distributed over an era of 778.2 km^2.
However, unbeknownst to many, NYC offers more green space than any other
major U.S. city. In fact, 99% of New Yorkers live within a 10-minute
walk from a green space. Despite this, these areas are often overlooked
due to the city’s dense, industrial layout. Our team aims to enhance
access to and awareness of these green spaces by documenting the
location of every garden in NYC and highlighting their features, such as
plant and animal life, available amenities, and environmentally friendly
practices. We are creating a comprehensive resource to empower NYC
residents with this valuable information.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Flora and fauna</strong>: Are gardens in specific boroughs
more likely to have various types of trees (street trees, trees in
gardens, fruit trees) than others, controlling for sidewalk area?</p>
<p><strong>Eco-friendly practices</strong>: Are gardens in certain
boroughs more likely to engage in eco-friendly practices than
others?</p>
<p><strong>Garden amenities</strong>: how does income in the area affect
the amount of garden amenities available to people? Do certain boroughs
have more garden amenities available than others?</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>We utilized three datasets in a collection on the NYC Open Data
website titled “GreenThumb Gardens”. The GreenThumb program provides
programming and material support to over 550 community gardens in New
York City. These datasets provide information about the NYC Parks
GreenThumb community garden program. The first dataset, titled
“GreenThumb Garden Info”, contains location and hours information on 629
community gardens. Location is described in a multitude of columns: zip
code, congressional district, assembly district, latitude, longitude and
more. We are also provided open hours of the gardens for each day of the
week.</p>
<p>Our second dataset, GreenThumb Site Visits, contains quantitative and
qualitative information related to the physical status of the garden, as
well as its ongoing operation, maintenance, and programming. Site visits
are done by NYC Parks staff, who are also responsible for collecting the
data available in this dataset in order to ensure each park is operated
in a safe manner and to understand the needs of different gardens. This
dataset is extremely relevant to our project as it contains columns
about eco-friendly practices and garden amenities for 357 gardens.</p>
<p>The third dataset is GreenThumb Block-Lot, which contains information
about the size of 1,397 gardens through columns describing the location,
size and area of the garden lot.</p>
<p>In addition to our primary GreenThumb datasets, we used additional
datasets to supplement our analysis and include external variables. We
used US Census Bureau’s S1903 Median Income in the Past 12 Months (in
2023 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) dataset to obtain the median income for
each borough. For each county, we extracted the median income estimate
(in dollars) for each county as well as the margin of error. We also
extracted county names and recoded them to borough names. Since the
columns were all character type, we converted to numeric for analysis.
The median income variable was then used to visualize the distribution
of median income by borough and in a Poisson analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="cleaning-exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Cleaning &amp; Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>Our analysis was split into three categories, each with its own
cleaning, exploratory and formal statistical analysis steps. After
importing the Garden Info and Site Visits datasets, we prepped the data
to merge them for analysis. Cleaning steps included using
janitor::clean_names() to tidy variable names and recoding the “borough”
variable to express each borough’s full name rather than just a
representative letter (e.g. “Bronx” instead of “X”). Each analysis
category involved selecting variables of interest from the Site Visits
dataset before merging it with the Garden Info dataset.</p>
<div id="flora-and-fauna" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Flora and Fauna</em></h3>
<p>The variables of interest for this data set were as follows: parksid,
inspectionid, trees in garden, fruit trees, street trees, chickens,
pond, fish in pond, turtles, and total sidewalk area. We converted these
variables to numeric form through the mutate function so they could be
properly analyzed. Merging this dataset by parksid to the Garden Info
dataset resulted in a flora_fauna_df, a new data frame with grouped
flora and fauna by borough that was used for subsequent visualizations
and analyses. A map of the flora and fauna was created through the
leaflet package. The dataset was then pivoted to create a multi-series
bar chart to reflect the distribution of flora and fauna features by
borough. To understand how the presence of different types of trees
differ across boroughs, a logistic regression was run for each tree type
in the data set (trees in gardens, fruit trees, and street trees). The
outcome was probability of tree presence, and the predictor variable was
borough. Sidewalk area was chosen as a confounder because it was the
closest representation of garden size, which would be associated with
both borough and tree presence. Brooklyn was made the reference group
for borough because it has the largest number of community gardens.</p>
</div>
<div id="eco-friendly-practices" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Eco-friendly Practices</em></h3>
<p>For this dataset, we focused on variables of interest: parksid,
inspectionid, rain harvesting, composting, aquaponics, and solar panels,
converting these to numeric form using the mutate function. We merged
this cleaned dataset with the Gardens Info dataset to create a new data
frame called eco_friendly_df. After merging, we grouped the eco-friendly
practices by borough with the group_by(borough) function. To prepare for
data visualization, we further refined the data to retain only the
relevant variables (borough, rain harvesting, composting, aquaponics,
and solar panels) and reshaped it with pivot_longer to focus solely on
the eco-friendly practices. We explored the distribution of these
practices using a multipart histogram to illustrate the prevalence of
each practice by borough. Additionally, we created a map of the city
that highlighted the location and addresses of each garden along with
their corresponding eco-friendly practices. To deepen our analysis, we
conducted a Chi-Square test of independence to examine the association
between borough and the presence of eco-friendly practices, complemented
by several logistic regression analyses to model the probability of a
garden engaging in eco-friendly practices based on its borough.</p>
</div>
<div id="garden-amenities" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Garden Amenities</em></h3>
<p>After selecting garden-amenity-related columns from Site Visits
(borough, garden name, ParksID), we merged the two datasets to create an
optimal dataset for garden amenity analysis. Three main exploratory
analyses were performed to assess garden amenities. To explore the
distribution of garden amenity types, five garden amenity types (open
lawn/communal area, murals, pond, farmer’s market, food) were selected
from the original Site Visits dataset. The distribution of the types of
garden amenities were visualized through a histogram; food and open
lawns were the most common type of garden amenity. Garden amenity counts
were then visualized by borough via histogram; Brooklyn had the greatest
number of garden amenities, while Staten Island had the least. Income
distribution by borough was visualized through a column chart, where
Manhattan had the greatest income. The income distribution visualization
was an exploratory step before running a Poisson analysis assessing the
association between total amenities per borough and median income by
borough.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="formal-statistical-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Formal Statistical Analysis</h2>
<div id="flora-and-fauna-1" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Flora and Fauna</em></h3>
<p>Several logistic regression analyses were run to model the
probability of various types of trees (street trees, trees in garden,
fruit trees) being present in a garden based on the borough that it is
located in, controlling for sidewalk area. We hypothesized that there
would be an association between tree presence and borough based on
socioeconomic disparities and resources available to attend to the
gardens. The p-values for a majority of the coefficients comparing
Brooklyn to the remaining four boroughs deemed them insignificant. The
only significant finding at the 5% level (and its interpretation) was as
follows: The odds of a fruit tree being present in a community garden in
Queens was 0.202 times the odds of a fruit tree being present in a
community gardens in Brooklyn, controlling for sidewalk area (p-value:
0.007).</p>
</div>
<div id="eco-friendly-practices-1" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Eco-friendly Practices</em></h3>
<p>We conducted a Chi-Square test of independence to investigate the
association between borough and the presence of eco-friendly practices,
aiming to determine whether the presence of these practices in a garden
was independent of its borough. We hypothesized that there would be a
strong association between gardens practicing eco-friendly practices and
borough. The results (X^2 = 153.11, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16) indicate a
strong association between eco-friendly gardens and the boroughs they
are located in. To further investigate, we performed several logistic
regression analyses to model the probability of each eco-friendly
practice being used by gardens based on the borough they are located in.
We hypothesized that there is an association between borough and gardens
with eco-friendly practices. The findings from our analyses are as
follows: Gardens in Brooklyn exhibited the highest likelihood of rain
harvesting, with an odds ratio of 2.10 (p = 0.04). Gardens in Manhattan
were most likely to engage in composting, with an odds ratio of 5.30 (p
= 0.00), while the use of solar panels had an odds ratio of 0.667;
however, this association was not significant, as the p-value exceeded
0.05. We did not include aquaponics in our logistic regressions because
only n=2 gardens utilized aquaponics, which resulted in a very small
sample size that could skew models. To confirm our theory about
aquaponics models, we conducted a residuals analysis through violin
plots. Aquaponics has the greatest residuals of all the models,
indicating poor model fit compared to rain harvesting, composting and
solar panels. Rain harvesting and composting have the best model
fit.</p>
</div>
<div id="garden-amenities-1" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Garden Amenities</em></h3>
<p>We used a Poisson analysis to assess the association between total
amenities per borough and median income by borough. This analysis was
run to determine whether income by borough (predictor) had any
association with the number of amenities per borough (outcome). A
Poisson analysis was chosen with no offset since the outcome variable
was a count. Our hypothesis was that the predictor would have a strong
association with the outcome, since higher socioeconomic status is
typically associated with more open, clean green space. However, our
hypothesis was not confirmed based on this analysis. The coefficient for
median income is negative (-0.0000092), which means that as median
income increases, the expected count of garden amenities decreases
slightly. The odds ratio (OR = 0.9999908) indicates that a one-unit
increase in median income is associated with a negligible decrease in
the count of garden amenities. This change is statistically significant
(p-value = 0.0000013), suggesting that median income has a minor
negative effect on the number of garden amenities.</p>
<p>Finally, we completed a multinomial logistic regression with
predictor variables of median income and garden status, and outcome of
whether the garden had a pond. For this analysis we did not include
gardens in Staten Island (due to low sample size) nor did we include
gardens that were not under DPR jurisdiction, as those gardens would not
be part of the GreenThumb program and would therefore impact the effect
of the “status” variable. Individuals in the GreenThumb program have
significantly lower odds (OR = 0.214) of having garden ponds compared to
those not in the program, as indicated by a p-value of 0.000. This
suggests that the program is associated with fewer garden ponds,
reflecting its impact on gardening behaviors.Median borough income does
not significantly influence the likelihood of having garden ponds (OR =
0.9999998, p-value = 0.9305), indicating that changes in income levels
do not substantially affect the presence of garden ponds. Gardens in
Brooklyn and Manhattan have higher odds of having a pond than gardens in
other boroughs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="garden-amenities-2" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Garden Amenities</em></h3>
<p>Our analysis revealed key insights about the distribution of garden
amenities and their association with socioeconomic factors across New
York City boroughs. First, we found that food and open lawn/communal
areas were the most common garden amenities citywide. Brooklyn stood out
as the borough with the highest number of amenities, while Staten Island
had the fewest. A separate exploratory analysis of median income
distribution by borough showed that Manhattan had the highest median
income.</p>
<p>When examining the relationship between median income and the number
of garden amenities per borough using a Poisson regression model, we
found an unexpected result: there was no positive association between
higher income and more amenities.These findings partially deviated from
our expectations. While the descriptive results regarding the
distribution of amenities aligned with expectations—for example,
Brooklyn’s prominence as a hub for community gardens—the Poisson
analysis did not support our hypothesis that higher median income would
be associated with more garden amenities. This suggests that factors
other than income, such as community engagement, city planning policies,
or historical investment in urban green spaces, may play a more
significant role in shaping the availability of garden amenities.</p>
<p>Our statistical analyses returned a surprising amount of insights
from the data. Firstly, the predominance of food and open lawn/communal
areas may reflect the priorities of NYC’s community gardens, focusing on
food security and spaces for community interaction. Secondly, the
disparities in garden amenities by borough highlight differences in
access and investment. Staten Island’s lower amenity count may suggest a
need for targeted interventions to enhance green space utility and
accessibility.The lack of a significant association between income and
garden amenities challenges common assumptions about the socioeconomic
distribution of green spaces. This finding raises important questions
about equity in urban green space distribution and warrants further
investigation into other factors, such as community advocacy or land
availability, that influence garden development. Future analyses could
include more advanced models with more predictor variables (such as
racial distribution and population density) to determine factors behind
public access to green spaces and their amenities.</p>
<p>The multinomial regression analysis on garden ponds in NYC reveals
that the GreenThumb program significantly reduces the odds of having
garden ponds, indicating that it may redirect gardening efforts towards
other amenities. Median income does not significantly impact garden pond
presence, suggesting that factors beyond socio-economic status—such as
cultural preferences or local ecological conditions—are more
influential. The higher odds of garden ponds in Manhattan and Brooklyn
highlight geographical variability in urban gardening practices,
reflecting different community values and ecological conditions. These
findings have important implications for urban policy, emphasizing the
need to tailor green infrastructure strategies to local contexts and
preferences to effectively enhance urban green spaces and
biodiversity.</p>
</div>
<div id="eco-friendly-practices-2" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Eco-Friendly Practices</em></h3>
<p>In regards to Eco-friendly practices, our analysis revealed
significant findings regarding the association between borough and the
adoption of eco-friendly practices in gardens across New York City. The
Chi-Square test of independence indicated a strong association (X² =
153.11, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16), suggesting that the likelihood of
engaging in eco-friendly practices varies significantly across different
boroughs. We had to exclude aquaponics and Staten island from the
logistic regression models as Staten Island only had three gardens, not
enough gardens in New York City engaged in aquaponics. The logistic
regression analyses showed that gardens in Brooklyn were significantly
more likely to implement rain harvesting practices, with an odds ratio
of 2.10 (p = 0.04). In contrast, gardens in Manhattan exhibited a
noteworthy preference for composting, as indicated by an odds ratio of
5.30 (p = 0.00). However, while there was an association of solar panel
usage, the odds ratio of 0.667 did not achieve statistical significance
(p &gt; 0.05). These findings align with our initial hypothesis, which
anticipated a strong association between boroughs and the prevalence of
eco-friendly practices. The higher likelihood of rain harvesting in
Brooklyn and composting in Manhattan suggests that specific
environmental initiatives may be influenced by borough characteristics,
including community engagement, availability of resources, and local
policies promoting sustainability.</p>
<p>The insights reflect the need to address geographical disparities in
eco-friendly practices within urban gardening. The significant variance
among boroughs highlights opportunities for targeted educational and
community-driven initiatives designed to promote green practices,
particularly in boroughs where engagement may be lower. Moreover,
understanding the unique characteristics of each borough can inform
local government and nonprofit organizations in developing tailored
strategies that encourage more widespread adoption of sustainable
practices, ultimately contributing to a greener New York City.</p>
<p>Additionally, our exploration of the gardens’ data not only amplifies
awareness of existing green spaces but also emphasizes the potential for
these areas to serve as catalysts for environmental change. By
documenting and promoting eco-friendly practices in gardens, we can
empower NYC residents to enhance their engagement with these valuable
resources, leading to broader community benefits for both the
environment and public health. In conclusion, our findings suggest that
while certain boroughs lead in specific eco-friendly practices, there
remains room for growth in promoting sustainability across all regions
of NYC. Future studies may further explore the factors influencing these
practices and examine how targeted outreach can enhance eco-friendly
engagement citywide.</p>
</div>
<div id="flora-and-fauna-2" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Flora and Fauna</em></h3>
<p>The multi-series histogram reflecting the distribution of plants and
animals in NYC gardens by borough highlighted Brooklyn as the leading
borough. There were more gardens in Brooklyn with trees in the garden,
fruit trees specifically, and street trees than in any other borough. In
addition, there were more gardens with chickens in Brooklyn than in the
other boroughs. Brooklyn has more community gardens than any other
borough, which would offer an explanation for these numbers. Other flora
and fauna features, like turtles and fish, only appeared in gardens in a
few boroughs. For example, turtles only appeared in gardens in
Manhattan. In addition to allowing for a comparison of how plants and
animals differ by borough, this histogram provides information on how
prevalent the various features are. It also informs statistical analyses
about factors associated with the differences in how the features are
distributed.</p>
<p>As reflected in the histogram, there are more trees of all kinds in
Brooklyn than in any other borough. This prompts the following question:
Is there a significant difference in tree presence based on borough when
controlling for confounding variables? A major confounder of this
presumed association is garden size, but the data set only includes
information on sidewalk area. As this is the closest indicator of garden
size, and is the only meaningful confounder present in the data set, it
was used in the analyses. The logistic regression models use tree
presence as the outcome and borough as the predictor, including sidewalk
area in the models as a confounder. The presence of only significant
finding (an OR of 0.202 when comparing Queens to Brooklyn) indicates
that the findings from the histogram are explained by the fact that
Brooklyn has more gardens than the other boroughs, and not because
gardens in Brooklyn have a significantly greater frequency of trees than
gardens in other boroughs. These findings are limited by the lack of
information on other confounder variables that would allow for a more

<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>We were inspired by the efforts to maintain the [BedStuy Aquarium]
(<a href="https://www.bedstuyaquarium.com/"
class="uri">https://www.bedstuyaquarium.com/</a>), a makeshift aquarium
that started with a leaky fire hydrant, until it was shut down in
October. Despite this community pond sadly being shut down by the NYC
government, we wanted to remind everyone there are still several gardens
with ponds and fish available for public enjoyment!</p>
