# **About**
Info about gardens in NYC
"Through this program we also promote urban agriculture, connect gardeners to resources in their communities, and help to identify supportive community and school gardening policies.

Urban agriculture is defined as growing food and raising animals in cities, accompanied by complementary activities such as processing and distributing food, collecting and reusing food waste and rainwater, and educating, organizing, and employing local residents. Some examples of urban agriculture include hydroponics, urban apiary, aquaponics, backyard chickens for egg production, and rooftop farming."
